                    <h3>Missing Child Identification (Deep learning and Multiclass SVM):</h3>
                    <p>  Created a website to trace missing children using
                        deeplearning and multiclass SVM. The suspicious children photo will be automatically compared with the registered photos of
                        the missing child from the repository. In this CNN is used for Feature Extraction and SVM for Feature Recognition.
                        Tech Tools: Deep learning Technologies(CNN, SVM)</p>
                    <p>In India a countless number of children are
                        reported missing every year. Among the missing
                        child cases a large percentage of children remain
                        untraced. This paper presents a novel use of
                        deep learning methodology for identifying the
                        reported missing child from the photos of
                        multitude of children available, with the help of
                        face recognition. The public can upload
                        photographs of suspicious child into a common
                        portal with landmarks and remarks. The photo
                        will be automatically compared with the
                        registered photos of the missing child from the
                        repository. Classification of the input child
                        image is performed and photo with best match
                        will be selected from the database of missing
                        children. For this, a deep learning model is
                        trained to correctly identify the missing child
                        from the missing child image database provided,
                        using the facial image uploaded by the public.
                        The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a
                        highly effective deep learning technique for
                        image based applications is adopted here for
                        face recognition. </p>

                    <h3> Volume Control using Hand Gestures(Python):</h3>
                        <p> Created to control volume using Hand Gestures in the computer. The
                        setup consists of a single camera to capture the gesture and we use OpenCV module to recognize the gestures.
                        Tech Tools: Python, Open CV</p>
                    <p>Hand gestures is the powerful communication medium
                        for Human Computer Interaction (HCI).Several input
                        devices are available for interaction with computer, such as
                        keyboard, mouse, joystick and touch screen, but these
                        devices does not provide easier way to communicate. In this,
                        the system which is proposed will consists of desktop and
                        laptop interface, hand gesture can be used by the users need
                        to wear data gloves also can use the web camera or separate
                        cameras for recording the hand gestures.
                        The first and most important step toward any hand
                        gesture recognition system is to implement hand tracking
                        system. Some Sensor devices are generally used in DataGlove based methods for digitizing hand and finger motions
                        into multi parametric data. Other sensors used in this system
                        will collect hand configuration and hand movements. Hand Gesture Recognition by using Hidden Markov
                        Models - In this paper the author has made a system to
                        recognize the numbers from 0-9 using the dynamic hand
                        gestures. The author has used two steps in this paper .In the
                        initial stage preprocessing is done and in second step
                        classification is carried out. Basically, there are two types of
                        gestures Key gestures and Link gestures.</p>
